# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and GRU Models

### Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models, two advanced deep learning techniques specifically designed for time series forecasting. The project leverages historical stock price data, including features like Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, to build predictive models that forecast future stock prices.

### Dataset

Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical stock price data for various companies, with each entry representing a single day of trading. Below is a detailed description of each column in the dataset:

- Ticker: The stock symbol for the company. Each entry in this column represents a different company, such as 'A' for one specific company.
- Date: The date of the stock price data entry, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. This column helps in organizing the data chronologically, allowing time-based analysis and forecasting.
- Open: The price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day. It represents the price at which the stock first traded when the market opened on that particular day.
- High: The highest price that the stock reached during the trading day. This shows the peak price the stock was sold for on that particular day.
- Low: The lowest price the stock reached during the trading day. This represents the bottom point during the day for the stock price.
- Close: The last price at which the stock was traded during the day. Itâ€™s typically used as the reference price for that day and is often the most important data point for financial analysis.
- Adj Close (Adjusted Close): The closing price of the stock adjusted for actions like dividends, stock splits, etc. This is crucial for a more accurate reflection of stock performance, as it accounts for such events that affect stock value but not the market price directly.
- Volume: The total number of shares that were traded on that particular day. This is an important indicator of market activity, showing how much interest or liquidity there is in the stock for that day.

### Steps Involved

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Data cleaning: Handle missing values (if any).
- Date formatting: Convert Date to datetime format.
- Feature scaling: Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler to bring all features into the range [0, 1].
- Time-series formatting: Create sequences of past stock prices as features to predict the future stock prices.

2. Model Building:
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is effective for time-series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): A simpler alternative to LSTM, often providing similar performance with fewer parameters.

3. Model Training:
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Train the models using the training set and evaluate the performance using the validation set.
- Monitor the loss (MSE) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) over the epochs.

4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the models based on validation loss and validation MAE.
- Compare the performance of the LSTM and GRU models.

5. Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions, regardless of direction.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors, penalizing larger errors more.

### Results

The LSTM model shows steady improvement and generalizes well to the validation set, making it a strong candidate for forecasting stock prices. The LSTM model demonstrated superior performance in stock price prediction, with lower validation MAE and loss compared to the GRU model. It is suitable for deployment in forecasting stock prices.

The GRU model performed less well than LSTM, with higher loss values and MAE. The GRU model showed high initial loss, which decreased over time, but it still lagged behind the LSTM model in terms of performance. The GRU model, although improving over epochs, did not reach the level of performance seen in the LSTM model. It might require further tuning or a more suitable architecture for time-series forecasting.

### Future Work

1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning both models to optimize their performance.

2. Feature Engineering: Adding more features such as moving averages, volatility, and sentiment analysis to improve the model.

3. Ensemble Models: Combining the predictions from multiple models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) to enhance accuracy.

4. Evaluation on Multiple Stocks: Expanding the analysis to include multiple stock tickers for broader forecasting applications.
